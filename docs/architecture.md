# Architecture Overview

### 游대 Current Architectural Pattern

- **Layered & Modular Approach:**
  - Splits the application into presentation, logic, and integration layers via **Smart (Container) Components** and **Dumb (Presentational) Components**.
  - Organized into discrete **Feature Modules** (e.g., Dashboard, Card Management, Bulk Operations, Auth) that encapsulate all related components, services, and assets.

### 游대 Documentation & Tooling

- **Automated Documentation:**
  - Planning to integrate **Compodoc** to generate comprehensive documentation directly from the codebase, similar to how backend documentation is handled with Springdoc.
- **Inline Code Annotations:**
  - Extensive inline documentation is provided to clarify component responsibilities, service interactions, and module boundaries.

### 游대 Routing & Navigation

- **Angular Router:**
  - Implements a robust routing strategy with clearly defined paths for dashboards, card details, and form views.
  - Supports **lazy loading** of feature modules to enhance performance and reduce initial load times.

### 游대 Reactive Programming & State Management

- **RxJS for Reactive Patterns:**
  - Leverages RxJS for managing asynchronous data streams and user interactions.
- **State Management Options:**
  - For enhanced scalability and maintainability, the use of **NgRx** (or similar) is being evaluated to manage application state as the project grows.

### 游대 Bulk & Batch Operations

- **Efficient Batch Processing:**
  - Implements techniques to efficiently handle bulk actions (e.g., mass updates, file imports) on gift card data.
  - Mirrors backend batch processing paradigms by providing user feedback (via progress indicators and inline error reporting) during operations.

### 游댩 Future Enhancements

- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Investigates Angular Universal for server-side rendering and additional build tool optimizations to improve the overall user experience.
